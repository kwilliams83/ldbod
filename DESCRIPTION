Title: Local Density-Based Outlier Detection
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kristopher Williams
Maintainer: Who to complain to <kristopher.williams83@gmail.com>
Description: Flexible procedure for computing local density-based outlier scores for ranking outliers.  Both exact and approximate nearest
    neighbor search can be implemented, while also accomodating multiple k values and four different local density-based methods.  See
    RANN package documentation for details on nearest neighbor search procedure.  It allows for subsampling of input data or a user specified reference data set to compute outlier scores against,
    so both unsupervised and semi-supervised outlier detection can be done.
