Title: Local Density-Based Outlier Detection
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kristopher Williams
Maintainer: <kristopher.williams83@gmail.com>
Description: Flexible procedures to compute local density-based outlier scores for ranking outliers.  Both exact and approximate nearest
    neighbor search can be implemented, while also accomodating multiple k values and four different local density-based methods.
    It allows for referencing a random subsample of input data or a user specified reference data set to compute outlier scores against,
    so both unsupervised and semi-supervised outlier detection can be implemented.
Depends:
    RANN,
    mnormt
