### Overview

The **ldbod** package provides flexible functions for computing local density-based outlier scores.  Functions included in this package can be used for computing local density-based outlier scores in the unsupervised and semi-supervised setting.  Two functions are included ldbod() and ldbod2().  Function ldbod(X,k,...) computes outlier scores referencing random subamples of the input data, X.  Fucntion ldbod2(X,Y,k,...) computes outlier scores based on a reference data set, Y.  Y can be a set of "normal" data points for semi-supervised outlier detection.

Nearest neighbor search is carried out using k-d tree with option for 
approximate nearest negibhors.  Refer to **RANN** package for more details on how nearest neighbors are computed.  

and includes two functions ldbod() and ldbod2(), which allow for random subsampling and
